TCC- PetFast" Project   TCC is nothing more than the "Final paper" in English, this website came up with the intention of facilitating the connection between client and supplier of petshop services in general, with an interface, connections and other simple functions that we learned during three years of System Development in the Etec Vila Formosa institution.  As stated above, this project was created to facilitate the connection between client and provider, bringing screenshots of NGOs, Petshops and Veterinarians, all of which have phone contacts, social networks and their websites.
